    <div class="verse">Oh, the science of Man has narrowed the span</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Between the near and the far,</div>
    <div class="verse">With thunderous roar the great ships soar</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From Earth to the dimmest star;</div>
    <div class="verse">But though in their lust for gold they thrust</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From planet to asteroid</div>
    <div class="verse">The Will of the Great Astronomer still</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is the Will of the cosmic void.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">And from Earth's own Sol to the ebon hole</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the Coalsack's gaping maw</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Now, Dougal MacNeer was a pioneer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Just one of a million such</div>
    <div class="verse">Who labor and toil in unmapped soil</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With shovel and pick and hutch.</div>
    <div class="verse">He was six-foot-two, and a man whom few</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Would care to engage in a fight,</div>
    <div class="verse">With shoulders as firm as a pachyderm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A tower of granite might.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">He had eyes of gray, and a quiet way</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of minding his own affairs;</div>
    <div class="verse">He never came down to a commerce town</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Save for fueling or ship repairs.</div>
    <div class="verse">Thus it was that he roused the <i>whys?</i> and <i>hows?</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the minds of the spaceport clique</div>
    <div class="verse">When he landed at Krull<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with his tanks half full</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And rented a berth for a week.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">The cradle-monk<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> stared, then boldly dared,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"By golly, you've struck it rich!</div>
    <div class="verse">I always knew some day you'd come through,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You lucky son-of-a&mdash;&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">"Which,"</div>
    <div class="verse">Asked Doug MacNeer with a smile sincere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"Is the best joy-joint in Krull?</div>
    <div class="verse">I've lived alone till my mind's ingrown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This prospecting life is dull.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"I want to go play from the dusk of day</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Till I waken to morning bells."</div>
    <div class="verse">The attendant said, with a nod of the head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"You amble to Venus Nell's.</div>
    <div class="verse">It's the hottest place in this end of space,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Just a couple of minutes' jaunt;</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell's got music and games, and likker and dames</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;And anything else you want!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"Thanks, that sounds great!" said Mac. But, "Wait!"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Begged the other, "Gimme a break!</div>
    <div class="verse">Help me out of this rut, MacNeer, and cut</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Me in on a share of the take?"</div>
    <div class="verse">"The take?" asked Doug with a little shrug,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"But <i>I</i> haven't made any find!"</div>
    <div class="verse">And he strolled away with a whistle gay</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While the monkey glowered behind.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">In a moment or two, Doug wandered through</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The gaudily-neoned door</div>
    <div class="verse">Of a feverish-gay, bright cabaret;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Below, on the mirrored floor</div>
    <div class="verse">Of the dancehall swayed a cavalcade</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of every breed and race</div>
    <div class="verse">Whose daughters and sons defy the suns</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To journey the ways of space.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">A miner from Mars, pockmarked with scars</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Pressed close to a woman from Io,</div>
    <div class="verse">A Jovian baby drawled lazily, "Maybe&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To pleas of a tar from Ohio;</div>
    <div class="verse">A vicious-mouthed slattern from faraway Saturn</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sang ditties to make the hair curl.</div>
    <div class="verse">And then&mdash;curtains parted, and Doug MacNeer started</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To see such a beautiful girl!</div>
  </div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">II</div>

</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Venus Nell was no saint, any preacher would paint</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A bad ending for her at a peek.</div>
    <div class="verse">But her worst enemy would be forced to agree</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">There was nothing wrong with her physique.</div>
    <div class="verse">She was flat where it flattered, and curved where it mattered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A creature of streamline and bubbles;</div>
    <div class="verse">She had bright yaller hair, and a definite flair</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For taking men's minds off their troubles.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">She never had known the cap or the gown</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of grammar- or high-school or college,</div>
    <div class="verse">Which didn't mean she couldn't win her A.B.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a certain and specialized knowledge.</div>
    <div class="verse">She had lure and illusion; creating confusion</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">'Mongst men was but one of her tricks.</div>
    <div class="verse">Doug's eyes opened wide when she strolled to his side</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;And he fell like a cargo of bricks!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">She drawled, "Howdy, sailor!" and Dougal turned paler,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"H-howdy!" he managed to answer.</div>
    <div class="verse">Then, in sudden alarm, "Are you one of the charm-</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gals?" he questioned, "Or only a dancer?"</div>
    <div class="verse">Now, why an admission of her true position</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nell should at that moment decide</div>
    <div class="verse">To conceal is a mystery buried in history;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whatever the reason, she lied.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">In fashion designed to make any man blind</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She lowered her lashes and blushed.</div>
    <div class="verse">(Which was no mean achievement itself.) "Oh, believe</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Me! I'm no&mdash;entertainer," she gushed.</div>
    <div class="verse">"I sell cigarettes, and I sometimes take bets</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">On the rocketship races&mdash;" MacNeer</div>
    <div class="verse">Slowly nodded his head as he quietly said</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"A girl like you shouldn't be here!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"I think we'd do well to get out of this hell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of evil and vice," he decided.</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell had to sit still and bite her lips till</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her inner amusement subsided.</div>
    <div class="verse">This curious sucker, it suddenly struck her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Meant business! His motives were pure.</div>
    <div class="verse">To lead on the calf should be good for a laugh ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She smiled at him, shy and demure.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"Oh, I cannot do that," she replied, "but a chat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a quieter spot&mdash;?" And she led</div>
    <div class="verse">Dougal out of the blare to a cool garden square</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With the stars burning high overhead.</div>
    <div class="verse">She gave orders by sign that a beaker of wine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be served in their shady retreat,</div>
    <div class="verse">And wondered how long it would be ere this strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Handsome stranger acknowledged defeat.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">But strangest to tell, it was Doug and not Nell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who emerged from that contest the victor.</div>
    <div class="verse">It was nothing he did, but a loneliness hid</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In her bosom that finally tricked her.</div>
    <div class="verse">For Doug spoke of the night, and the glorious flight</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of ships through the reaches of Space;</div>
    <div class="verse">Of his hopes and his schemes&mdash;and his words wakened dreams</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That softened the lines of Nell's face.</div>
  </div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">III</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">He was just on the verge of confessing the urge</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That brought him back out of the void</div>
    <div class="verse">When a servant discreet appeared in their retreat</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And Nell faced the fellow, annoyed.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Well?" she icily said. The man bobbed his head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"A visiphone call on the rack."</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell sighed as she rose. "Some friend, I suppose.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Wait, Dougal; I'll hurry right back."</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">An expression surprisingly soft in her eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She answered the visiphone.</div>
    <div class="verse">Her caller, however (the cradle-monk), never</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Detected her altered tone.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Hey, Nell, there's a chump on his way to your dump,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A big, quiet sort of a lout</div>
    <div class="verse">By name of MacNeer&mdash;" Nell told him, "He's here;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">What's all the commotion about?"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">A hungry grimace of greed mottled the face of</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The vengeful space-harbor assistant.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Do I get my percent for a tip on the gent?"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He parried in accents insistent.</div>
    <div class="verse">"You mean&mdash;?" whispered Nell. And, "Surer than hell!"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The answer came back, swift and eager,</div>
    <div class="verse">"I've just seen his log, and he's in from the Bog</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With a claim-stake the size of Omega!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Now, for those who don't know their A. L. &amp; O.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The "Bog" is a treacherous sector</div>
    <div class="verse">Of planetoids legion, a tightly-packed region</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Avoided by every prospector.</div>
    <div class="verse">None but the most daring do any space-faring</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In those lethal, whirlagig niches,</div>
    <div class="verse">But spacemen all claim that the Bog is aflame</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With infinite, fabulous riches.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'Twas thence that the crew of the L-32</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Returned with a cargo of ore</div>
    <div class="verse">That assayed ninety-one and a half to the ton</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;Or maybe a little bit more.</div>
    <div class="verse">It was out of the Bog that old space-weasel Scrogg</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Withdrew on his gravity-tractor</div>
    <div class="verse">The rock 4-Omega, which brought such a figure</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Scrogg set himself up as a Factor.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">So it's easily seen why Nell's new, serene</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Complaisance should disappear rudely.</div>
    <div class="verse">She gasped and she started; her crimson lips parted;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her eyes narrowed sharply and shrewdly.</div>
    <div class="verse">"You're positive?" Slyly responded the spy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"Why else would he put into Krull</div>
    <div class="verse">With motors O.Q., and flame-jets brand-new,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And fuel-chambers more than half-full?"</div>

    <div class="verse indent8">IV</div>

</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Now, though Nelly was young, as has often been sung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her chosen profession was old.</div>
    <div class="verse">Both instinct and habit advised her to "<i>Grab it!</i>"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whenever she heard the word "gold."</div>
    <div class="verse">She broke the connection, her vivid complexion</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">More flushed, and with movements exotic</div>
    <div class="verse">Returned to the glade in which Dougal had stayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her inner emotions chaotic.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">She studied MacNeer as she slowly drew near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Appraising him in a new light.</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell trusted her spy; he would not tell a lie&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But somehow it didn't seem right!</div>
    <div class="verse">MacNeer didn't act like a man who had cracked</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A cache of asteroid dough,</div>
    <div class="verse">And yet&mdash;Venus Nell smiled tightly&mdash;Ah, well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She'd know in a minute or so.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">With a cute little shrug she curled on the rug</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And smiled into Doug's sober face.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Go on!" she implored, "and tell me some more</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">About your adventures in Space.</div>
    <div class="verse">Have you ever struck gold in the terrible cold?"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her voice was a query and taunt.</div>
    <div class="verse">Doug grinned at her there as he fondled her hair.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"I've found all the gold that <i>I</i> want!"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Nell's eyes opened wide. "You have?" she replied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And suddenly somewhere within her</div>
    <div class="verse">A duel transpired 'tween the Nell who admired</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This miner and Nelly the sinner.</div>
    <div class="verse">Which would have won out is a matter of doubt</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But Dougal MacNeer, growing bolder,</div>
    <div class="verse">At that moment tossed dice with Fate&mdash;and he lost!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;By placing a hand on her shoulder.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">He bent to her ear, and, "Nelly, my dear,"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He whispered, "Come lift gravs with me</div>
    <div class="verse">To the skyways above ... I'll teach you to love ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">How wonderfully happy we'll be...."</div>
    <div class="verse">And&mdash;that was a story to Nell old and hoary;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nell shrugged with a gesture resigned;</div>
    <div class="verse">A lustful and bestial man, just like the rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of his sex....</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">And she made up her mind.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Averting her face, she escaped his embrace</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And whispered, "Wait here for a minute&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse">A prearranged sign brought a fresh jug of wine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To Doug&mdash;with a sleeping drug in it.</div>
    <div class="verse">Dougal, gleaming of eye, the glass lifted high</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And drank it down, swiftly and deep;</div>
    <div class="verse">In no time at all, he lay there asprawl</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In impotent, stertorous sleep.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">A pungent aroma jarred Doug from his coma</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Much later. He lifted his head</div>
    <div class="verse">To find he was not in the cool, shady grot</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But in some sort of workshop, instead.</div>
    <div class="verse">His senses were blurry, his tongue thick and furry;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He gagged at the odor and choked.</div>
    <div class="verse">Then, head still awhirl, he noticed the girl,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And, "Nelly, where are we?" he croaked.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">But the girl standing there with the bright yaller hair</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was hardly the girl of his dreams.</div>
    <div class="verse">She was distant and cold, her manner was bold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her eyes glistened brightly with schemes.</div>
    <div class="verse">With icy <i>élan</i> she spoke to the man</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At Dougal's side, "Very well, Gurk,</div>

    <div class="verse">"Work, Nell?" Dougal gasped, and confusedly clasped</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His hammering head in his hands.</div>
    <div class="verse">He learned, then, that he was bound, foot and knee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To his seat by unbreakable bands.</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell said with a numb, deadly smile, "Don't play dumb!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be smart and you'll shorten this visit.</div>
    <div class="verse">We know from your log you struck gold in the Bog;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Now, come clean and tell us&mdash;where is it?"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"G-gold?" gulped MacNeer. "Th-there's some mistake here!"</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He grinned, "Aw, you're kidding me, honey!</div>
    <div class="verse">Now, be a good sport&mdash;" The girl cut him short,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"I don't think this matter is funny!</div>
    <div class="verse">I gave you a chance to go into your dance;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If you won't, why&mdash;" She shifted her eyes</div>
    <div class="verse">To her white-coated aide. "Well, Gurk, I'm afraid</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He must talk through the <i>menavise</i>."</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">As Doug MacNeer's eyes opened wide in surprise</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gurk drew from a nearby cask</div>
    <div class="verse">A shimmering, fiery helmet of wire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A sinister sort of mask.</div>
    <div class="verse">Doug never had seen the fantastic machine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Before, but he'd oftentimes heard</div>
    <div class="verse">Of the dreaded and hated device that translated</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Men's thoughts into spoken words!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">With a terrible cry of anger, on high</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He lifted his brawny fists,</div>
    <div class="verse">But an instrument clicked, and manacles snicked!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Like vises about his wrists.</div>
    <div class="verse">"Well, <i>now</i> will you tell us?" persisted Nell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"There's nothing to tell!" he said.</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell's warm lips drew fine, and she made a brief sign ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the helmet dropped over his head!</div>

    <div class="verse">It was Nell who depressed the stud that expressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In flaming, electric flood</div>
    <div class="verse">The current that boils its way through the coils</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of a menavisal hood.</div>
    <div class="verse">There was silence at first, then the silence burst</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a moment of horror fraught,</div>
    <div class="verse">As Doug MacNeer's voice babbled clear</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In fragments of tortured thought.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"<i>I don't understand ... I can't move a hand ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>head aches, and my brain is on fire....</i></div>

    <div class="verse">"<i>Must be a mistake ... I can't be awake</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The orbit of Ceres is reckoned</i></div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">The shimmering died, and to Dougal she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"MacNeer, all we want to know</div>
    <div class="verse">Is: <i>Where is the gold?</i> As soon as you've told</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We promise to let you go."</div>
    <div class="verse">"I've told you already," gasped Doug, unsteady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"You're wrong if you think I'm rich&mdash;"</div>
    <div class="verse">Nell's scarlet mouth curled. "Fool! Liar!" she snarled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She viciously closed the switch.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">Once again sallow flame trembled hot through the frame</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the <i>menavise</i>; once again</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Of Dougal's tormented brain.</div>
    <div class="verse">"<i>The torments of hell&mdash;but I never can tell ...</i></div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Such secrets are better hid.</div>
    <div class="verse">He babbled of dreams, and hopes and schemes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And names long lost in the past;</div>
    <div class="verse">He spoke of flight through the endless night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And of cosmic reaches vast.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">But never he told of wealth or gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Though now he was growing weak;</div>
    <div class="verse">Till finally the girl turned to her churl</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Lips set, and as marble bleak.</div>
    <div class="verse">"He's stalled long enough!" she rasped. "He's tough,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he's held out for more than an hour;</div>

    <div class="verse">"That's up to him!" cried Nell, and grim</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of eye she approached the side</div>
    <div class="verse">Of Doug MacNeer, and, "Listen here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You obstinate fool!" she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse">As she pressed the key to the last degree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">"You know very well you told</div>
    <div class="verse">Me you'd found all the gold that a man could want</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">&mdash;Now, answer: <i>Where is that gold?</i>"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">The <i>menavise</i> flamed, the battered and maimed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hulk standing before them jerked</div>
    <div class="verse">As the blistering pain seared Dougal's brain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">MacNeer's lips horribly worked....</div>
    <div class="verse">And across the tomblike expanse of the room</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His feeble answer carried:</div>
    <div class="verse">"... <i>lonely as hell ... must ask sweet Nell ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>It's time I was getting married....</i>"</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"<i>I think that she ... and I could be ...</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>So happy ... a golden prize....</i></div>
    <div class="verse"><i>But ... Oh, the pain!</i>" And he screamed again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The light died out of his eyes.</div>
    <div class="verse">And Nell stood aghast, to have seen at last</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The terrible answer bare:</div>
    <div class="verse">The gold of his dream was the glorious stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of her own bright yaller hair!</div>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
